1. Make sure you have at least 14 days before the domain expires. Leaving a couple of days extra for mishaps is a **good idea**.
2. Remove `whois` privacy and **wait until a `whois` on the domain shows the non-private information**.
3. Unlock domain.
4. Get auth code.
5. Make sure email address on account is correct.
6. Go to new registrar and request transfer.
7. Be sure to accept transfer when you get the email requesting it.
