_I'd like to start by thanking [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshmock) for convincing me to go this route instead of [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) (which is particularly relevant since [I'm using a pretty pedestrian laptop nowadays](https://treylabs.com/2019/07/17/apps-on-rosie/) and Docker containers should be nicer to my RAM than virtual machines)._

1. Download and install [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).
2. Create a folder where all the WordPress files will live and `cd` into it.
3. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file (shown below) in the folder.
4. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
5. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and finish the installation process.

Now you can create and modify themes and plugins in their proper places within the folder you created.

Here's how you work with your fancy Docker setup from now on:

- To stop the containers, run `docker-compose stop`.
- To start everything back up, run `docker-compose start` or `docker-compose up -d`.
- To stop the containers and delete everything, run `docker-compose down --volumes`
- To use phpMyAdmin, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Save this file as `docker-compose.yml` in the folder you created:

```yaml
