I’m a web developer with nearly two decades of professional experience. I like building accessible, [progressively-enhanced][pe] things because I believe the web should work for everyone.

I have [a business][tl] where I make [cool things mostly for photographers][cn].

## I’m looking for (remote) work. Here's stuff I'm into.

- Building [component libraries][cn-patterns].
- Building [static-generated sites][11ty].
- Working with Django and Python.
- Things that meet the spirit and intention of [the IndieWeb][indieweb].
