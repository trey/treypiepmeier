I could do without this book. The beginning of it is fine, but it's just the end of The Waste Lands. There's no reason for this part to be in a separate book (other than that King said that part of the story wasn't in him yet).

The middle is tedious and overlong and has almost no bearing on the rest of the series. I actually just skipped it this time through and read some plot summaries online.

The ending is silly and inconsequential and feels like it means nothing. There's no real peril and bringing back the Tick-Tock Man meant nothing. He was gone as soon as he was revealed.

If I ever read through this series again, I will probably skip this book altogether.
