Cassette Nest will make it a lot easier to place an order for film processing.

It often takes me a while to figure out what all I need to order. How many rolls of 35mm? How many of 120? How many have I pushed and by how much?

Hereâ€™s what my `/ready` page on Cassette Nest looks like right now:

{% include components/img name: 'ready-to-process' ext: 'png' alt: 'A table showing film ready to process.' %}

I can quickly see everything I need to place an order. Everything is tallied up both for film type (Color, Slide, Black & White) and format (35mm, 120), and how many things (if any) need to be pushed or pulled.

Is this missing anything you would find helpful? [Let me know!](https://twitter.com/cassettenest)
