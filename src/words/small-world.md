This was a fun and mostly lighthearted story. The Locke & Key one-offs have gone different ways in terms of tone. This story ties into [one of the heavier ones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13647975-locke-and-key), but only hints at its heaviness.

Small World has a series of page-by-page cliffhangers that didn’t get old and visual gags that made me laugh.

If you’re into Locke & Key, you’ve already read this. If you are and haven’t, go buy it and do so.
