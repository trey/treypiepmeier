1. [Alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)): Classic. Nearly perfect and, of course, the best one.
2. [Aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)): Holy smokes this is a good movie! It holds up so well. The practical effects are golden. The suspense is so well done. [Ripley is such a badass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsxW-xzLhGQ).
3. [Alien³](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_3): Not bad. CGI looks super dated, though. I’m sad that gender is still such a problematic thing in the future.
4. [Alien Resurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Resurrection): The [Gremlins 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01l_jMhjVM) of [Alien movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(franchise)#Films). I did enjoy nihilistic clone Ripley and (spoilers) [the human/Xenomorph hybrid at the end saying “Oh no! Oh no!” as its being sucked out into space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4_-rVenLVs) (is there any other way to end an Alien movie?) was really something. I beg you not to click on that link.
