Previously: [Cassette Nest: Tracking Film Photography](/words/2019/01/cassette-nest-update-1/)

One of the things I want to track in Cassette Nest is very basic information about where and when each frame of a roll was taken.

Currently, I record this information using [PhotoMemo books](https://shootfilmco.com/products/photomemo-photographers-memo-book-2-pack).

{% include components/figure name: 'journaling-1' caption: '~2017-now: PhotoMemo' alt: 'A PhotoMemo book with lots of notes in it.' %}

Before I discovered those, I used a variety of different notebooks:

{% include components/figure name: 'journaling-2' caption: '2016: <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a>' alt: 'A Field Notes book with film notes in it.' %}

{% include components/figure name: 'journaling-3' caption: '~2015: <a href="https://analogbook.com/">Analogbook</a>' alt: 'An Analogbook with lots of notes and wasted space.' %}

After a roll is finished…

I adjust the “Capture Time” in Lightroom.

{% include components/figure name: 'journaling-4-always11am' ext: 'png' caption: 'Always 11:00 AM' alt: 'The Edit Capture Time dialog in Lightroom Classic' %}

I print out a copy of each two-page spread of the notebook and keep it in a sheet protector with my negatives.

{% include components/figure name: 'photo-memo-copies-and-index' caption: 'Copied PhotoMemo pages with my 2018 annual index.' alt: 'PhotoMemo pages and annual index in sheet protectors ready to be loaded into a film binder.' %}

The journaling feature will take the place of recording things in a notebook, but I probably won’t give them up. Having an immediate hard-copy of that information is good piece of mind.

Here’s the gist of how it’ll work.

- One entry per day.
    - The most important information that I want to capture for every frame on a roll is what day it was taken.
- Record the last frame exposed for the day.
    - You’ll only have to say where you ended up for the day. The interface of the application will show you the range of frames.
- Record a note for the day.
    - This can be as short or as detailed as you want. Formatted with Markdown.

From there, the process (for me, anyway) will be pretty much the same. The one major difference is that instead of copying pages from a PhotoMemo, you’ll be able to print out all the information for a roll right from the app (I need to start working on those [print style sheets](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/print-stylesheets-in-2018/)).
