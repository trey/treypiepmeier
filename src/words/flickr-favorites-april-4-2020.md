I wanted to share some things that I’ve been enjoying on my favorite social photo platform, Flickr. If you’re not on there, you should be! Here’s a sampling of recent photos that I’ve added to [my favorites](https://www.flickr.com/photos/trey_piepmeier/favorites).

This one is a classic in our household, but I somehow hadn’t officlally added it as a favorite until recently.

This is the way you took a screenshot in 1986 apparently.

Photographing [post offices](https://www.flickr.com/photos/trey_piepmeier/albums/72157703369402784) and mail trucks is a hobby of mine, so it’s good to see someone else with a good take on the subject.

I recently went to see a talk by local photographer and seafood plant manager [Phil Mello](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bigfishphil/). I loved to see that he used film as well as digital cameras in his work.
