I always remember this book fondly because I was able to get a copy of 1st edition hardback from my local comic shop when it first came out. It was the first of the Dark Tower novels that came out after I had gotten into the series.

After the 3rd or 4th time through, this is still a hell of a good read. There are parts of it that are tiring to me (the whole haunted house / speaking ring thing), but overall I just like being in this world with these characters. There are things in this that I probably wouldn’t tolerate if I were coming to it new. “Oh, now they can communicate telepathically because ‘ka.’ Ok.” It’s a good enough story that I can let it go, and there’s precedence for such things, but sometimes it feels a bit corny.
