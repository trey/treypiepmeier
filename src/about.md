# {{title}}

I’m a photographer and web developer. I live in Massachusetts. I’m originally from Tennessee. I’m into film photography, but digital cameras are cool too.

I’ve worked on some random projects over the years including a [Stephen King Checklist](https://sk.listsofbooks.com/) and [a podcast about Star Trek](https://jawgrind.com/). I'm currently building [an app for film photographers](http://cassettenest.com).
