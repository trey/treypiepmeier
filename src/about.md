# {{title}}

I’m a photographer and web developer. I live in Massachusetts. I’m originally from Tennessee. I’m into film photography, but digital cameras are cool too.

I’ve worked on some random projects over the years including a [Stephen King Checklist](https://sk.listsofbooks.com/) and [a podcast about Star Trek](https://jawgrind.com/). I'm currently building [an app for film photographers](http://cassettenest.com).

Here’s [my résumé](https://resume.treypiepmeier.com).

## [Colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing))

- Built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and [Blank Slate v2](https://github.com/trey/blank2).
- Code syntax highlighting styles from [Prism](https://prismjs.com) and [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/).
- Social network icons from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org).
- Still using [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for some reason.
- I used [PNG to JPG](https://png2jpg.com) on that little homepage image. I had probably taken a screenshot of the photo to begin with rather than export it like a responsible person.
